   Assumption I made based on bidding process :
   Once a new bid is placed it will check to see if the price of the current bid
    is within the auto-bid range and follow the process below.

   On the server side, the server will collect all auto bids for a current auction. 
   The price of the current bid will be checked to see if it is in range of any auto bid
    and it will make a list of all auto bids within the range. 
    From here, it processes the auto bids until the price is no longer within range of any auto bids.
    
   If two bidders place auto bids for identical amounts on the same project, 
   and this amount is the low bid when the auction closes, the first auto bid 
   that was placed(CreatedDate) will be the winning bid.

What would you change in the exercise and/or process?
A craft project allows the candidate to work without pressure, 
hence bringing out their abilities in less stressful environment.
On the spot coding exercises during phone interviews may not show case
